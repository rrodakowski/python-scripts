### python-services
This is a collection of python modules that I use for scripts.

### How to Use

Copy the lib modules into your python project and import classes from the required module into your application.

### Requirements

Tested with python3.5.

The imagelib module uses ImageMagick to perform all image processing
and has an S3 file manager that requires:

pip install boto3
pip install awscli

The graphlib module uses pygal: pip install pygal
