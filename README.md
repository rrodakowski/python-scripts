### python-services
This is a collection of python modules that I use for scripts.

### How to Use

Copy the lib modules into your python project and import classes from the required module into your application.

### Requirements

Tested with python3.5.

The imagelib module uses ImageMagick to perform all image processing.

The graphlib module uses pygal:pip install pygal
