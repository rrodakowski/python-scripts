### python-services
This is a collection of python modules (and classes) that I find useful when writing python scripts for small tasks. 

### How to Use

Create a python package in your python project and import classes from the required module into your script/job/application. 

### Requirements

Tested with python2.7. 
The images module requires the project pytumblr pillow. You can find pytumblr on github and can install pillow with: 

pip install Pillow
